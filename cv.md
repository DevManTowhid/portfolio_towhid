## Projects  
### **1. Lorenz Chaos Cryptography Engine **
**[Github]([https://github.com/DevManTowhid/](https://github.com/DevManTowhid/Deterministic-Chaos-A-Non-Linear-Dynamic-System-for-Real-Time-Stream-Cipher-Generation))**
  -- browser-based application that leverages Deterministic Chaos to generate pseudo-random encryption keys. By solving the Lorenz Differential Equations in real-time, the system demonstrates the "Butterfly Effect"—extreme sensitivity to initial conditions—and utilizes this property to perform XOR Stream Encryption on text data.

  -- This project bridges the gap between Control Systems/Physics and Cybersecurity, visualizing the exact moment two nearly identical systems diverge.

- Impact: Streamlined booking for 100+ users during testing.  


### **3. SKetchRefine**
**[Github](https://github.com/DevManTowhid/SketchRefine)**
  - Shape Detection: The app captures freehand sketches using HTML5 Canvas and 
applies numerical methods to detect if the drawing approximates a straight line, circle, or 
ellipse. 
  - Shape Refinement: Once a shape is recognized, the app snaps the sketch to a perfect 
geometric form, turning rough doodles into clean, precise designs.
